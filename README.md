# language_and_compiler
This is the codebase of all of my work in programming language and compiler courses. The course covers topics including functional programming language, OOP, compiler, and interpreter, and it also dives deep into key concepts like higher-order function, closure, function environment, parsing, and grammar in programming languages that are transferable in many modern languages. 

## Key highlights & takeaways
In this course, I wrote my own testing cases to verify whether my program was working as I expected it to be. I find it extremely insightful to write good test cases in the beginning. Not only does it uncover holes in my logic, but it also helps me be more considerate and thorough in the first place. At the end of this course, I wrote a scanner and a parser that works together in Ruby that can take input from users, process complex expressions into interpretable tokens, and calculate and output the result with deterministic grammar.
